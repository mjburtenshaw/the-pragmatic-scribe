Motivation
----------------

> *"Human-readable forms of data, and self-describing data, will outlive all other forms of data and the applications that created them. Period. As long as the data survives, you will have a chance to be able to use it--potentially long after the original application that wrote it is defunct."[^1]*
> 
> *- Dave Thomas*

The root repository of knowledge is the mind. All other storage mediums are attempts to ensure that knowledge against loss. When it comes to insurance, I think these are the most important attributes:

1. Fidelity.
2. Redundancy.
3. Accessibility.

Fidelity is the most important attribute of a storage system because it doesn't matter what you store if it's not the same at retrieval. Any written medium is superior to human memory because the latter has a faster decay rate, notwithstanding the questionability that knowledge is even written to brains correctly in the first place.

Redundancy matters more than accessibility because it doesn't matter how accessible data is if the store is lost. Digital storage is superior to paper storage because it's quicker to back up. If the storage medium is at risk of decay, redundancy makes it easier to back up new systems, solving for longevity.

This is not to say that accessibility isn't essential. It's paramount because data is useless unless it's read.

Audience
-------------

> *"Communication is not about speaking what we think. It's about ensuring others hear what we mean."*
> 
> *- Simon Sinek*

Understanding your audience is pivotal in crafting effective documentation. Whether you're writing for fellow developers, end-users, or project stakeholders, tailoring your documentation to meet their needs is essential.

Style
--------

Just as software code follows coding conventions and style guides, documentation should adhere to its own stylistic guidelines. Consistency and readability are key factors in creating documentation that resonates with its readers.

Placement
--------------

Where and when should documentation be introduced in the software development process? We'll discuss the optimal points in a project's lifecycle to create and update documentation to ensure it remains relevant and valuable.

Having documentation in any place is good, but having it in the *right* places is better.

Maintenance
------------------

> *"Docs work best when they are alive but frequently trimmed, like a bonsai tree"[^2]*
> 
> *- Google*

Documentation is not a one-time effort; it requires ongoing maintenance to stay up-to-date and accurate. We'll cover best practices for keeping your documentation in sync with your codebase, even as it evolves over time.

Paradigms
---------------

Like any philosophy, different paradigms attempt to live up to the form. Some examples of these paradigms include docs-first, docs-last, code-as-docs, test-as-docs, and wikis. These paradigms agree that documentation provides a net benefit to a system and is worth pursuing; they differ in method.

I would like to introduce a pragmatic approach. But first, let's cover some documentation formats.
