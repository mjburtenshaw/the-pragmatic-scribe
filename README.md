Introduction
-------------------

In the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, the role of documentation cannot be overstated. Documentation serves as the lifeblood of any software project, enabling developers to understand, maintain, and extend codebases effectively. This comprehensive guide will explore the intricacies of creating high-quality documentation catering to novice and experienced software engineers.

A Note on Systems
---------------------------

Before delving into the specifics of documentation, it's crucial to understand the systems that documentation interacts with. Software development is not isolated; it's part of a larger ecosystem that includes various tools, technologies, and paradigms. We'll briefly touch upon these systems to provide context for the importance of documentation in this complex environment.

See [systems](https://github.com/mjburtenshaw/macpracs/blob/main/systems.md).

Philosophy
----------------

See [philosophy](philosophy.md).

Formats
-----------

Documentation comes in various forms, each with its unique strengths. We'll explore semantic code, comments, markdown, and DBML formats, discussing when and how to use them effectively.

See [formats](formats.md).


The Pragmatic Scribe Paradigm
----------------------------------------------

See [paradigm](paradigm.md).

First Class Documentation
---------------------------------------

Documentation isn't a monolithic entity; it varies based on the context. We'll categorize documentation into different classes, each tailored to specific aspects of a project.

### Project Docs

Project-level documentation provides an overview and governance for the entire software project. We'll explore key documents like README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTORS, and more.

See [project-docs](project-docs.md) for details.

But how do we document things that apply to multiple projects?

### Initiative Docs

See [initiative-docs](initiative-docs.md) for details.

Conclusion

A pragmatic scribe will not likely need to apply every strategy covered here on a single project. But they have these tools at their disposal and know when best to apply each one.

The purpose of documentation is to transfer knowledge from your mind to those of others across time and space. Though tools and paradigms may change, the pragmatic philosophy remains to achieve that purpose, and the philosophy demands change when it's appropriate.
